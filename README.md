# What is this?
This used to be a literate config, but as I started using this config across multiple machines it got to be hard to make work on all three.

So instead, I went with profiles. Right now, I only have two public ones:
- The one on my Thinkpad x250, running NixOS: https://github.com/alphor/.emacs.d/blob/master/x250.org
- The one on my MacOS: https://github.com/alphor/.emacs.d/blob/master/macOS-personal.org
